# Careem Ridsharing Dashboard

## Overview

This project showcases an **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** designed to transform raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard contains five distinct tabs, each focused on a specific area of business analysis. The goal of this project was to build a scalable and dynamic tool for data-driven decision-making.

The dataset used for this project was hypothetical data generated by ChatGPT in a structured format but required significant preprocessing. I used **Excel**, **DAX**, and **Power BI** to clean, transform, and enrich the dataset, ensuring it was analysis-ready.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for this project was hypothetical and structured but required significant preprocessing to make it analysis-ready. Here are the steps I undertook:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values.
   - Standardized formats for dates, text, and numerical values.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX** for key metrics such as success rates, cancellation rates, and revenue breakdowns.
   - Merged, grouped, and aggregated data to fit the requirements of each tab.

3. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Derived additional fields (e.g., average distance traveled, revenue by customer) for better insights.

4. **Tools Used:**
   - **Excel:** For initial data cleanup and formatting.
   - **Power BI:** For modeling, visualization, and advanced calculations.
   - **DAX:** For creating calculated columns, measures, and dynamic filters.
